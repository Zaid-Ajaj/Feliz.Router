# Feliz.Router [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Feliz.Router.svg?maxAge=0&colorB=brightgreen)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Feliz.Router)

An Elmish router that is focused, powerful yet extremely easy to use. Made for developer happiness.

Here is a full example

```fs
open Feliz
open Feliz.Router

type State = { CurrentUrl : string list }
type Msg = UrlChanged of string list

let init() = { CurrentUrl = [ ] }, Cmd.none

let update (UrlChanged segments) state =
    { state with CurrentUrl = segments }, Cmd.none

let render state dispatch =
    let currentPage =
        match state.CurrentUrl with
        | [ ] -> Html.h1 "Home"                                                  // /#
        | [ "users" ] -> Html.h1 "Users page"                                    // /#/users
        | [ "users"; Route.Int userId ] -> Html.h1 (sprintf "User ID %d" userId) // /#/users/42
        | _ -> Html.h1 "Not found"

    Router.router [
        Router.onUrlChanged (UrlChanged >> dispatch)
        Router.application currentPage
    ]

Program.mkProgram init update render
|> Program.withReactSynchronous "root"
|> Program.run
```

### Installation

```
dotnet add package Feliz.Router
```

The package includes a single element called `router` that is to be included at the very top level of your `render` or `view` function
```fs
let render state dispatch =

    let currentPage = Html.h1 "App"

    Router.router [
        Router.onUrlChanged (UrlChanged >> dispatch)
        Router.application currentPage
    ]
```
Where it has two primary properties
 - `Router.onUrlChanged : string list -> unit` gets triggered when the url changes where it gives you the *url segments* to work with.
 - `Router.application: ReactElement` the element to be rendered as the single child of the `router` component, usually here is where your root application `render` function goes.

### `Router.onUrlChanged` is everything

Routing in most applications revolves around having your application react to url changes, causing the current page to change and data to reload. Here is where `Router.onUrlChanged` comes into play where it triggers when the url changes giving you the *cleaned url segments* as a list of strings. These are sample urls their corresposing url segments that get triggered as input of of `onUrlChanged`:
```fs
segment "#/" => [ ]
segment "#/home" => [ "home" ]
segment "#/home/settings" => [ "home"; "settings" ]
segment "#/users/1" => [ "users"; "1" ]
segment "#/users/1/details" => [ "users"; "1"; "details" ]

// with query string parameters
segment "#/users?id=1" => [ "users"; "?id=1" ]
segment "#/home/users?id=1" => [ "home"; "users"; "?id=1" ]
segment "#/users?id=1&format=json" => [ "users"; "?id=1&format=json" ]
// escaped query string parameters are decoded when the url is segmented
segment @"#/search?q=whats%20up" => [ "search"; "?q=whats up" ]
```

### Parsing URL segments into `Page` defintions

Instead of using overly complicated parser combinators to parse a simple structure such as URL segments, the `Route` module includes a handful of convenient active patterns to use against these segments:
```fs
type Page =
    | Home
    | Users
    | User of id:int
    | NotFound

type State = { CurrentPage : Page }

type Msg = PageChanged of Page

let update (PageChanged nextPage) state =
    { state with CurrentPage = nextPage }

// string list -> Page
let parseUrl = function
    // matches #/ or #
    | [ ] ->  Page.Home
    // matches #/users or #/users/ or #users
    | [ "users" ] -> Page.Users
    // matches #/users/{userId}
    | [ "users"; Route.Int userId ] -> Page.User userId
    // matches #/users?id={userId} where userId is an integer
    | [ "users"; Route.Query [ "id", Route.Int userId ] ] -> Page.User userId
    // matches everything else
    | _ -> NotFound

let render state dispatch =
    let currentPage =
        match state.CurrentPage with
        | Home -> Html.h1 "Home"
        | Users -> Html.h1 "Users page"
        | User userId -> Html.h1 (sprintf "User ID %d" userId)
        | NotFound -> Html.h1 "Not Found"

    Router.rotuer [
        Router.onUrlChanged (parseUrl >> PageChanged >> dispatch)
        Router.application currentPage
    ]
```
Of course, you can define your own patterns to match against the route segments, just remember that you are working against simple string.

### Programmatic Navigation

Aside from listening to manual changes made to the URL by hand, the `Router.router` element is able to listen to changes made programmatically from your code with `Router.navigate(...)`. This function is implemented as a *command* and can be used inside your `update` function.

The function `Router.navigate` has the general syntax:
```
Router.navigate(segment1, segment2, ..., segmentN, [query string parameters])
```
Examples of the generated paths:
```fs
Router.navigate("users") => "#/users"
Router.navigate("users", "about") => "#/users/about"
Router.navigate("users", 1) => "#/users/1"
Router.navigate("users", 1, "details") => "#/users/1/details"
```
Examples of generated paths with query string parameters
```fs
Router.navigate("users", [ "id", 1 ]) => "#/user?id=1"
Router.navigate("users", [ "name", "john"; "married", "false" ]) => "#/users?name=john&married=fase"
// paramters are encoded automatically
Router.navigate("search", [ "q", "whats up" ]) => @"#/search?q=whats%20up"
```

Here is a full example in an Elmish program.

```fs
type State = { CurrentUrl : string list }
type Msg =
    | UrlChanged of string list
    | NavigateToUsers
    | NavigateToUser of string

let init() = { CurrentUrl = [ ] }, Cmd.none

let update msg state =
    match msg with
    | UrlChanged segments -> { state with CurrentUrl = segments }, Cmd.none
    // notice here the use of the command Router.navigate
    | NavigateToUsers -> state, Router.navigate("users")
    // Router.navigate with query string parameters
    | NavigateToUser userId -> state, Router.navigate("users", [ "id", userId ])

let render state dispatch =

    let currentPage =
        match state.CurrentUrl with
        | [ ] ->
            Html.button [
                prop.text "Navigate to users"
                prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch NavigateToUsers)
            ]
        | [ "users" ] ->
            Html.div [
                prop.children [
                    Html.h1 "Users page"
                    Html.button [
                        prop.text "Navigate to User(10)"
                        prop.onClick (fun _ -> dispatch (NavigateToUser "10"))
                    ]
                ]
            ]

        | [ "users"; Route.Query [ "id", Route.Int userId ] ] ->
            Html.h1 (sprintf "Showing user %d" userId)

        | _ -> Html.h1 "Not found"

    Router.router [
        Router.onUrlChanged (UrlChanged >> dispatch)
        Router.application currentPage
    ]
```
